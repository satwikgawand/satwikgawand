# About Me 

👋🏻 Hey there, I'm Satwik Gawand 🦄.

✨ I design for hoomans and code for computers.

🧑🏻‍🎓 I'm pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence @ [APU](https://apu.edu.my)

🛠 I'm building a small icon pack as well as a suite of small-scale Python projects.

📝 I'm writing blog articles about Productivity, Design and Code @ [Medium](https://satwikgawand.medium.com)

💡 I'll be more than happy to collaborate on a project. I can contribute in the area of _design_, _Python_, and _AI/ML_.

🌈 I have a few hobbies which include but not limited to exploring and learning new things, bike rides, collecting cute stuff, trying different food and drinks, binge watching anime and sleeping.
